			<h2>How can you predict the amount of people who actually come?</h2>

			<h2>Do you charge for this service?</h2>
			<p>By signing up for our beta acount, you can have up to 20 scheduled events for free. If you need more than 20 scheduled events, please <a href="{$CURHOST}/contact">contact us</a> and we will increase your limit.

			<h2>What methods can I use to invite my guests?</h2>
			<p>Facebook, import a CSV, upload Gmail or Yahoo! contacts, or add from your trueRSVP contacts (which includes all guests previously added). Though if you do choose to use Facebook, keep in mind that your invitees won’t show up under your guestlist until they RSVP!</p>

			<h2>How are you different from all the other event planning sites out there?</h2>
			<p>We’re not about fancy invitations and we’re replacing the traditional “Yes, No, Maybe” ways of RSVP systems. We’re giving event planners a REAL tool to help make their lives easier. No other site will give you a more accurate estimate of how many people are going to show up.</p>
