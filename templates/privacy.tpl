				<p>Limit the Personal Data You Provide: You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data or with limiting the Personal Data you provide. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data or limit the Personal Data you provide, you may not be able to use certain Site functionality and/or Company Services.

				<p>Opt Out: You can "opt out" of receiving Company newsletter emails by logging in, clicking on "Account" and following the instructions to "email preferences." You may modify your choices at any time in your Company account. In the event an Organizer uses our system to email you, you will be able to "opt out" of receiving those communications as well. Please note that if you unsubscribe from receiving a particular Organizer's emails, you will no longer receive emails from the particular Organizer that are sent through our system (but you may still receive emails sent by that Organizer through means other than our system), however, you will still receive Company communications and communications from other Organizers whose events you have attended or are registered to attend or who have otherwise obtained your email address. Likewise, if you unsubscribe from Company communications you will continue to receive communications from Organizers. So you may have to unsubscribe from multiple emails before you stop receiving all communications. You can also unsubscribe from receiving all Organizer emails sent through our system. It may take up to 24 hours for us to process an unsubscribe request. Note that you cannot unsubscribe from Company Service communications via the Site. You can stop receiving Company Service communications only by contacting us at /contact-us/ and closing your account. By electing to stop receiving all communications from Company or through Company's system you will no longer receive any updates on your account or on events you are registered to attend or have previously attended, including communications regarding refunds. We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Site or Company Services, are not currently registered for an event, are not currently organizing an event and will have no need to receive further communications from Company or through Company's system. Even after you opt out of all communications, Company will retain your Personal Data and Non-Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you. However, Organizers who have received your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy may still use that Personal Data to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use Company's system to do so.</p>
