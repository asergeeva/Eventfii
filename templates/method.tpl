		<h2>What makes an event successful?</h2>
		<p>Its not the appetizers or the goodie bags. Its not even the agenda or the venue. Its the attendees - whether its a networking event or a birthday party, people go to events to connect with other awesome people. And, when you dont know how many of  these awesome people are coming, your events (and your budget) suffer.</p>
		<h2>But, until now there hasnt been an effective way to guage how many people are actually going to show up.</h2>
		<p>When 300 people RSVP to your event on Facebook or Evite, its likely that less than half of these people are going to be there. Why? Because they dont think their attendance is critical to the events success. Or, they support your event, but really have  no intention of actually coming. Or, maybe something better happens to come up. Whichever one of these it may be, you as a host won’t find out who is actually committed.</p>
		<h2>trueRSVP is a RSVP system based on repuatation that predicts the exact number of attendees that are actually going to show up.  Here’s how we work:</h2>
		<ul class="info-pics">
			<li>Easily send invites to all your friends and contacts</li>
			<li>Guests RSVP using options based on their actual behavior</li>
			<li>We tell you your trueRSVP, aka how many guests you should expect</li>
			<li>Check off attendance to improve 
your trueRSVP for your next event</li>
		</ul>
